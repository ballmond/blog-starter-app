Because of the uptick in COVID cases in Montgomery County and the state, we are returning to virtual worship services only (no in-person). Contact us for information about via Zoom. Just because we can’t meet at our church building regularly like we did before, doesn’t mean our church, and our faith, and our God isn’t alive and thriving. We are meeting regularly via Zoom for worship, praise, small groups, bible study, and fellowship. Please join us in praying for all affected by COVID-19 and racial discrimination, and those who are suffering economically during this time. If you would like to participate in any of our worship and praise activities please contact us at staff@gbcbb.org or gbcprayerwarriors@gmail.com.
